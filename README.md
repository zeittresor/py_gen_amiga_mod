# py_gen_amiga_mod
Creates a randomy algorithmic composed Amiga Protracker .mod file as a chiptune (using Python for Windows)


Each Testversion is different but all of them have a GUI to use it with windows, its generating the mods inside
the script folder.

Note: This project is in very early state, but each version is working already.
In this state the sounds are mostly crazy, the harmonic is the next step i am working on.

If you just want to visualize the notes created for each pattern use my script https://github.com/zeittresor/py_mod2pdf
(it is creating a PDF document of a selected Amiga Protracker .mod file).
 

Output Test:

gen_amiga_mod_alpha6_test-output.mod (converted to mp4) (max. the sound volume slider!):

Suggestion: Use a Amiga Computer or Emulator to play the output.
btw. a project is existing called "Protracker 2 Clone" (for Windows) just search for it, is good solution
to play the output of my script or just use VLC (for Windows or Linux) to play :-)
