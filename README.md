# py_gen_amiga_mod
Creates a randomy algorithmic composed Amiga Protracker .mod file as a chiptune (using Python for Windows)


Each Testversion is different but all of them have a GUI to use it with windows, its generating the mods inside
the script folder.

Note: This project is in very early state, but each version is working already.
In this state the sounds are mostly crazy, the hamonic is the next step i am working on that.

Suggestion: A project called "Protracker 2 Clone" (for Windows) is good solution to play the output of my script
or just use VLC to play :-)
