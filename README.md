# py_gen_amiga_mod
Creates a randomy algorithmic composed Amiga Protracker .mod file as a chiptune (using Python for Windows)

I use the Protracker 2 Clone (for Windows) to test the generated output:
![protracker_gen_amiga_mod3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaeac7eb-d1d5-4fb0-8989-9453153a107f)

Each Testversion is different but all of them have a GUI to use it with windows, its generating the mods inside
the script folder.

Note: This project is in very early state, but each version is working already.
In this state the sounds are mostly crazy, the hamonic is the next step i am working on that.
